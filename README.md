This Android mobile automation framework enables coders to test app UI and functionality.
BasePage class provides us with page capabilities and BaseTest provides us with test class capabilities 
as well as initializing appium server.
Pom.xml file contains dependencies and profiles (enables Jenkins integration).

This project provides integration with Google Sheets API. Specifically in this project it was used to print test values 
found in app but it can be used to print any value directly and automatically into google sheets.

This project provides Allure report integration. It enables you to generate a detailed report at the end of each run. This report 
contains a UI screenshot in case of test failure and provides fail details.

Have fun and good luck!
